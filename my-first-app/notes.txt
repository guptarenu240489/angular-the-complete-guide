1. with routerLink = "/servers" ==> it is absolute path and will be added too domain.
e.g localhost:4200/servers

2. with routerLink = "server" ==> this is relative path and will be added to current path.

if current path is localhost:4200 ==> localhost:4200/server
if current path is localhost:4200/servers ==> localhost:4200/servers/server

2. with routerLink = "../server" ==> it will go one level up and then add server

e.g
if current path is localhost:4200/servers ==> localhost:4200/server


=== Naviagting programmatically ===
 loadServers() {
    // navigating programmatically
    this.router.navigate(['/servers']);
  }
